# EcommerceAdmin-app
This is the admin site I created in order to handle the ecommerce frontend
application. The login page of this site has been created with Nextauth.js, and
a user can log in to this with their Google account. Using this site, you can
check different stats about your business, like the number of orders, the
details of every order, and your revenue for the day, week, or month. You can
add multiple different products and product images, you can add different
categories and specify their properties, you can select products to be featured
on the ecommerce app front-end, and specify the shipping prices. If you need
more than one admin, you can add additional admins if you wish to.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
